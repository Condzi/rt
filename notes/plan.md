Estimated time: ~4 Months: June - October.


# June - Preparation phase
- [ ] Project utilities (logger, file management, error management)
- [ ] DirectX 11 renderer pipeline for immediate, debug shapes (2D and 3D?)
- [ ] ImGui

Revise the plan because the collision aspect is a bit of an umbrealla term. Are we
gonna implement some simple AABB collisions, or some actual physics? Maybe 
RT + collision detection can yield some cool effects...?

# July - Prototyping
- [ ] Balls rendering
- [ ] Triangles rendering
- [ ] Lights @todo: be more specific (divide into categories)
- [ ] Materials @todo: be more specific (what properties, exactly?)

# August - Prototyping, porting to compute shaders?
@todo: be more specific
- [ ] 3D models

# September 
@todo: be more specific
- [ ] Editor
- [ ] Profiling 
- [ ] Optimizing
- [ ] Collision detection

# October
Writing the thesis document.
