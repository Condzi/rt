Estimated time: ~4 Months: June - October.


# June - Preparation phase
- [X] Project utilities (logger, file management, error management)
- [X] DirectX 11 renderer pipeline for immediate, debug 2D shapes
- [X] ImGui

Start with the Compute Shaders? What are the downsides of Coding Adventure & 
Raytraycing in One Weekeend? Can I combine them somehow to get something better?

# July - Prototyping
# August - Prototyping, porting to compute shaders?
# September 
- [X] Balls rendering
- [X] Materials
- [X] BVH
- [ ] Architecture refactor 
- [ ] Textures
- [ ] Quads
- [ ] Lights

@todo: be more specific
- [ ] Compute shader pipeline setup
- [ ] 3D models


# October
Writing the thesis document.


Miscealenous 
- [ ] Editor
- [ ] 3D immediate pipeline (to preview objects/scene in editor)
- [ ] Profiling 
- [ ] Optimizing

Simulation aspect:
- flag simulation
- water simulation
- smoke simulation
- some deformation? how about car physics stuff from Kamil?
